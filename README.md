# Data-Simulation & Visualization Experiments

A collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various physics simulations, mathematical visualizations and data-plotting experiments. Useful for learning, experimentation, visualization and as reference for mathematical/physics modelling in Python.

## 🔎 What’s Inside

- 2D wave visualizations (sine, cosine, tangent etc.)  
- 3D curve and helix plotting & animation  
- Projectile motion simulations — 2D and 3D point/trajectory models  
- Signal/phase simulations (e.g. AC-phase, dynamic phase waveforms)  
- Matplotlib & Plotly notebooks for basic and advanced plotting demos  

All code is self-contained, easy to run, and written for clarity and learning rather than production deployment.

## ✅ Highlights

- Simple, readable scripts — good for learning mathematics/physics + Python visualization  
- Variety of demos: wave mechanics, motion physics, 3D geometry, signal behavior  
- No heavy dependencies — only standard Python libs (NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, etc.)  
- Great for quick experiments or to build upon for larger simulation / ML / visualization projects  

## 🧰 Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher 
- Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`.
- Jupyter Notebook, if you want to run `.ipynb` files  

Install dependencies via:  
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib plotly seaborn
```

## 🚀 How to Try It

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zishaanmailk/Data-Simulation.git
   cd Data-Simulation
   ```
2. Run any script, for example:  
   ```bash
   python "2D Sine-wave.py"
   ```
3. Or open a notebook (if present) with Jupyter:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Then select a `.ipynb` to run visualization demos.  
  

## 🙋 Contributions & Modifications

You are welcome to:  
- Fork and experiment with scripts  
- Add new simulations (physics, math, data, etc.)  
- Clean up filenames and organize demo scripts & notebooks  

No strict contribution rules. Just explore, learn, and have fun.
